# Visualizing-the-Case-Network 

This project was developed by us in 24 hours for the LexisNexis 2017 Rise To Code hackathon. We were the runner ups of the competition and the project was also awarded the 5th place in the People's Choice Awards.

## Project Description:
In order to effectively analyze a legal case, legal researchers must have quick access to all the subsequent rulings that cite the case they are analyzing.
Subsequent rulings can have a supportive or destructive effect on any case, which makes it a necessity to understand the citing network.
Given a set of case law with citation information, create a network map showing the citation linkages between cases.
