"# Visualizing-the-Case-Network" 

In order to effectively analyze a legal case, legal researchers must have quick access to all the subsequent rulings that cite the case they are analyzing.
Subsequent rulings can have a supportive or destructive effect on any case, which makes it a necessity to understand the citing network.
Given a set of case law with citation information, create a network map showing the citation linkages between cases.
